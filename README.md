This is an example on how to integrate IBM Watson Assistant with C#.
This example uses the Assistant configuration defined in the [Watson Assistant Sample Application](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/assistant-simple).


To use it, you need to:
- Create a new resource of IBM Watson Assistant
- Create a skill and import the training file from the Watson Assistant Sample Application
- Replace the Assistant parameters in the application settings

The support for actions in the client are not working at the moment.
